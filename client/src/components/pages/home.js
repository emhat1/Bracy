                In today's world of Instagram and SnapChat, there is an increasing focus on particularly photogenic and/or funny-looking pets.

                As such, a number of dog and cat species are deliberately bred to give the desired aesthetics.   Unfortunately along with these external features, there are an increasing number of inbred medical issues causing the animal lifelong discomfort and pain, and often shortening their natural life.

                Additionally, a number of breeders are known to keep their animals in atrociaous conditions that affect both their physical and mental health longterm.

                If you are planning to own an ususual breed such as a Persian cat, a Frenchie, or a Scottish Fold, please be aware of their increased medical needs and try to avoid increasing the demand from breeders for such breeds.  Adopt, don't shop.
